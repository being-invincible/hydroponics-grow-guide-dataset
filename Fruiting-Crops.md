# Fruiting Crops

## Introduction

From a grower’s perspective, fruiting crops are very unique. They require a very specific set of light and nutrient mixes throughout the course of their lifecycles, the growing periods are much longer, and they generally require noticeably more skill and labor to grow. Luckily, it's for these reasons that when done correctly, adding fruiting crops to your crop list can be so gratifying. Not only that, but depending on where you live, access to fresh fruits and veggies can be extremely limited, making a fresh product that much more noticeable and enjoyable.

To grow fruiting crops well requires more information than what we can provide in this short guide. However, be sure to research both light and nutrient cycles for vegging and fruiting stages, in addition to proper long-term pest management. Since fruiting crops have to produce both vegetative and reproductive growth, nutrient requirements are much higher, particularly in the fruiting stages of the crop’s lifecycle, and it’s for this reason that nutrient levels in a system with fruiting crops require more active management than systems with greens or herbs.

We have only included strawberries in this guide as it is the easiest fruiting crop to grow in our ZipGrow Towers, and we do not recommend growing large-statured crops (like tomatoes) in our Towers. But should you choose to grow larger-bodies and/or vining crops, know that these plants may require trellising which may be done with string, wood, netting, or wire. Also note that the large plants may make your towers bulkier and more awkward to move.

## Strawberries

### About Strawberries

Growers can order strawberries from most big seed companies like Burpee’s or Johnny’s Seeds with dozens of varieties available. The two main types of strawberries are ever-bearing and june-bearing—we recommend ever-bearing (or “day-neutral”) varieties.

Strawberries are best grown from rootstock rather than seed. Vegetative growth (runners) tends to be much faster than sexual reproduction (seeds), so you can cut the time from planting to production by months or years by using rootstock. Strawberries are prone to pest and diseases. Use miticides to manage mites, and a fungicidal dunk before planting to prevent fungal infections.

**Remember: pesticides can be a useful tool for growing long grow-cycle crops, like fruiting crops. Should you choose to use chemical pesticides ALWAYS read the label before using your chosen pesticide. It is a legal document, straying from instructions is unlawful for commercial producers!

### Growing Strawberries

- **pH range:** 5.5-6.5
- **EC/PPM:** 0.8-1.4/400-700
- **Light hours:** 14-18
- **Temperature:** Range: 65–75°F Ideal: 70°F
