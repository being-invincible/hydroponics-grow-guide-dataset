### Arugula

**About Arugula:**
Arugula is a brassica, like mustard or kale. It carries a spicy punch in a tender leaf, making it a great addition to salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. Some varieties are spicier than others, with the Rocket variety being considered the spiciest of the three most popular (Astro, Rocket, and Sylvetta). Though arugula grows like lettuce and is in the family of brassicas, it’s often considered an herb.
