# Herbs

## What You Should Know

Herbs are some of our favorite crops to grow due to the outstanding flavor and aromas they pack into their typically small form factors. While these crops typically take longer to reach maturity, they will be sure to turn heads, whether you’re growing them for your friends and family or as a commercial producer. Much like everything else grown locally and with purpose, the qualities these herbs will possess are sure to blow away all preconceived notions of what they have to offer.

For commercial growers, herbs are typically high-value crops regularly bringing in $1.99/ oz.-$2.99/oz and more depending on the market. Most herb varieties are also capable of continuous yield, making them an excellent choice should your market support them. While some herbs can be easier to grow than greens, the longer maturation time can cause problems in the event something in the operation goes wrong. It takes longer for a grower to reach full production again after an incident; however, most herbs can be harvested multiple times.

## Basil

### About Basil

There are dozens of basil varieties, from spicy bush basil, to lemon basil, to Thai basil, all of which bring a delightful twist to any dish when paired well. Favorites are the classic sweet basil, Genovese basil, and dwarf basil. This wildly variable crop produces large harvests and is so fragrant and delicious you won’t want to stop growing it once you start.

## Chives

### About Chives

Common chives are the variety most used. A few other varieties, like garlic chives and Chinese chives are also available. Chives are a tough crop that will survive a wide range of temperatures and can even go without water for a while without it impacting quality. Chives are also fairly pest-resistant, rarely infected with diseases, and rarely are targeted by insect pests. Chives propagate rapidly from roots and can be planted by division (this is ideal since germination times on chives are relatively long). Growers using ZipGrow Towers can simply tear apart the roots of a plant from another ZipGrow Tower and use it to plant multiple others. Rarely will growers need to use seeds to grow chive seedlings as using rootstock is the fastest and most effective way to grow them.

### Growing Chives

## Cilantro

### About Cilantro

Cilantro can be a tricky crop to grow since it bolts very easily, especially in hot conditions. If bolting is triggered, trim the bolts and adjust environmental conditions. Be aware that the flavor of the greens becomes more bitter and harsh once the plant has bolted. Growers can purchase slow bolting seeds to minimize the potential for crop failure.

- **1st Harvest:** 7-9 Weeks
- **2nd Harvest:** 3-4 Weeks

## Fennel

### About Fennel

A mildly sweet herb with a taste reminiscent of anise, fennel is edible both as bulbs and greens. The greens may be harvested once before a full-plant harvest a few weeks later. Fennel prefers a lower EC and moderate pH. Though fennel often proves drought-tolerant, heat-tolerant, and cold-tolerant, it is not frost-tolerant. Fennel rarely struggles with pests if it’s kept healthy, although aphid infestations could affect the crop. Fennel has a wider range of germination rates, from about 60% to 90%. Be sure to get good seeds (Baker Creek and Johnny Seeds are both great places to start). Seeds take 1-2 weeks to germinate and are typically ready to plant 3-5 weeks later. The bulbs can be harvested as soon as the grower wants, but .5 to 1lb bulbs are standard at most markets. From seedlings it takes most plants 6-8 weeks to reach harvesting size.

### Growing Fennel

- **Planting:** Germinate from seed
- **Harvesting:** At first harvest, only take 30% of the greens, take the full plant on the second harvest
- **Yield:** 8-10oz / Foot of Tower / Harvest

## Mint

### About Mint

There are dozens of types of mint, but the main varieties are spearmint (Mentha spicata), peppermint (Mentha x piperita), and pennyroyal mint (Mentha pulegium). Some of the other mints like lemon mint (Monarda citriodora) are actually not mint at all. When mint is used in the kitchen, it’s usually spearmint. Mint can be grown from seed, but using cuttings or rootstock is much quicker, especially on a commercial scale. From mint cuttings, or “clones,” mint roots out and grows to maturity within a few weeks. For stem cuttings, you can select healthy green sprigs and simply set them in water. We’ve also used cotton or loose soil to set cuttings. For rootstock, you can pull out the media when a mature tower becomes overgrown, remove some root material to populate a new tower, and simply tuck the root material in the new media. Then replant both towers — one with old and one with new root material — and voila!

## Oregano

### About Oregano

Oregano (Origanum spp.) is a small, bushy herb with a strong unique flavor that’s especially pungent when the herb is fresh. The leaves are used fresh and dried in most types of cuisine, but especially Italian and French. There are three main kinds of oregano used for culinary purposes: Greek (Origanum vulgare hirtum), Mexican (Lippia graveolens, which actually isn’t oregano at all), and Italian (Origanum x majoricum). Oregano has small, rounded leaves that are fuzzy in some species – this makes it harder for them to deal with high humidity.

## Parsley

### About Parsley

Parsley is a Mediterranean native used worldwide both as a garnish and as a popular addition to savory dishes. Several varieties of parsley exist, from the more bitter and frilly garnish parsley to the flavorful, tender large leaf varieties. Though popular mostly as a cooking ingredient, parsley has been used in a variety of ways, from a medicinal ingredient to a symbol in ceremonies like the Seder dinner. Parsley’s tolerance of a wide temperature range and EC range make it an easy crop for farmers to add into a crop set. Large leaf varieties like Italian flat leaf grow abundantly in hydroponics (or aquaponics), and farmers using ZipGrow Towers should plan on harvesting a lot of weight from the large plants, which grow 12-18 inches from the face of the Tower or media.

### Growing Parsley

- **Planting:** Germinate from seed
- **Harvesting:** Multiple harvests—it’s common to harvest parsley twice before replanting
- **Yield:** 8-10oz / Foot of Tower / Harvest

## Rosemary

### About Rosemary

Rosmarinus officinalis belongs to the family Lamiaceae like many of our culinary herbs. Rosemary is a great fit for indoor farming because it can be very compact. Like its co-members of Lamiaceae, lavender and thyme, rosemary prefers “dry feet”. This means that growers should give roots a dry period between watering. Starting rosemary from seed can be a finicky process – the seeds need consistent moisture and germination rates tend to be around 30-50%. Growers are often better off propagating the plants from cuttings, although some argue that the best flavors and aromatics come from seed-grown plants.

### Growing Rosemary

- **Planting:** Germinating from seed is very difficult, propagation from clone is fastest and easiest
- **Harvesting:** Multiple harvests are common through pruning
- **Yield:** 0.8-1.1 oz / Foot of Tower / Harvest
- **Pests and Diseases:** Pests and diseases are rare, the most common are botrytis and powdery mildew when over-watered
- **pH Range:** 5.5-6.5
- **EC/PPM:** 1.2-1.8 / 600-900
- **Light Hours:** 14-18
- **Temperature:** Range: 60–80°F and cold hardy Ideal: 75°F
- **Germination Seedling:** 2-3 Weeks
